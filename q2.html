    <h1>HTML entitiies</h1>
    <p>
        HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have special meanings in HTML, or 
        characters that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. They are used to ensure that these characters 
        are correctly displayed in web pages and are interpreted correctly by web browsers.
